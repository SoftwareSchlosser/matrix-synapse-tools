**synapse_purge.py** is a script for cleaning up your home server.  
**CAUTION**  
**The script DELETES FILES from your file system and REMOVES EVENTS from your database!**  
The script is under development and it's still in alpha stage. Please read the script and **only use it if you understand what it does!**  
Always use the *--dry-run* parameter first to see what the script is about to do!  
Always pass enough parameters to limit deleting / removing to specific times / users / rooms etc.
